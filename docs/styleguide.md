# Itoc Terraform Styleguide

## No main.tf
All Terraform files should be named after their purpose

## All workspace and modules should have variables.tf and outputs.tf
This is to help provide default structure to all workspaces and modules

## Pinned providers
Help prevent things breaking

## providers.tf (not versions)

## Editorconfig

# Naming Conventions

## AWS Resources
* Hyphen case
* Naming convention of custprefix-workload-region-whatever

## Terraform resources
* Snake case
